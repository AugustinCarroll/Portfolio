                <h3>Self-Directed Music Composition Course</h3>
                    <p>
                        I designed this course in Canvas as part of my Learning Design coursework at Harvard. The course is designed for adult hobbyist composers with some musical background 
                        who want to develop personalized skills to compose music in their chosen style. I chose to make this course entirely self-directed to accommodate the irregular
                        learning schedules of my audience, and to allow them freedom to choose where they focus their time, according to their own interests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using the Understanding by Design (UbD) framework, I defined the 2-3 year transfer goals as: 
                        1) Learners will be able to analyze music in ways that lead to insights applicable to their own compositional practice; 
                        2) Learners will be able to apply compositional craft (e.g. developing material from small musical ideas, creating structure and transitions); and 
                        3) Learners will be able to reflect on and refine their own creative process.
                        To this end, each module culminates in a flexible project that allows the learner
                        to apply new skills and self-evaluate their learning progress.

                <h3>Interactive Programming Lesson</h3>
                    <p>
                        I created this interactive lesson in Articulate Storyline to introduce programming logic to learners with little to no prior 
                        coding experience. The primary design challenge was to overcome the common misconception that programming means learning an entirely 
                        different "language", and to help learners connect programming concepts to their pre-existing understanding of basic logic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To address this challenge, I combine computer-language conditional operators (IF, ELSE) and logical operators (AND, OR, EQUALS) with
                        natural-language actions. For instance, "IF the weather EQUALS sunny, go on a walk." I also created line-by-line walkthrough interactions that provide scaffolding
                        by explaining each line of code. These interactions are optional, allowing learners to only use as much guidance as they need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because this is meant to be introductory, the assessments are formative, and learners can attempt activities multiple times, with the feedback
                        serving as part of the learning process instead of graded evaluation. These assessments progress from simple recall and understanding to
                        deeper analysis and problem-solving, culminating in an open-ended programming task in which the learner writes a simple program from scratch.

                <h3>Branching Scenario</h3>
                    <p>
                        I designed this scenario in Articulate Storyline 360 to help sound designers develop collaborative and organizational skills they need to work in game development.
                        The module immerses the learner in a simulated project so they can practice solving tough problems that arise all the time in real game development. Design
                        decisions were informed by my own experience working as a sound designer with small development teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The primary design challenge was to present the learner realistically tough choices with meaningful consequences without feeling overwhelming or
                        punishing. Because the target learner is familiar with games and interactive media, I used a narrative, game-like design to engage them while 
                        supporting the desired learning outcomes. The scenario challenges are personified with an illustrated character who chats with the learner in a casual tone. 
                        Audio and animation cues draw focus to key concepts and help learners intuitively navigate the interface. The experience is also scaffolded with
                        notes that add context and suggest possible outcomes, so that the learner doesn't feel completely unassisted in their decision-making.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scenario ends by giving feedback on each of the choices the learner made and how it affected their performance. This encourages
                        self-evaluation and reflection on their process, critical skills in real-world projects.

                <h3>Webinar Revision</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a short assignment I completed as part of my Instructional Design coursework at Harvard. Rather than creating my own content from scratch, I was asked to revise slides from an existing webinar using Mayer's Multimedia Principles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The original slides contained too much information and lacked coherent visual cues, making it very easy for the audience to become overwhelmed. I assessed cognitive barriers and iterated through multiple versions to improve clarity and learner comprehension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike other projects in my portfolio, this is a small-scale, analysis-focused exercise in which I apply learning science to existing content rather than building courses or interactive experiences from scratch.
